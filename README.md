This application helps the user to convert text or numbers to another base.

- Text pivot page supports Base64 and Hex conversion (please, keep in mind that Hex conversion here is not the same as number).

- Number pivot page supports conversion from/to Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hex bases. Input scope of the textbox changes accordingly to improve user interface.
